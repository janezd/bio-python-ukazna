    "**Task: Counting the frequency of individual letters in DNA sequences** \\\n",
    "**Due date: 2025-05-25**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a python script that counts how many times each letter (e.g., A, C, G, T) appears in a given text file containing DNA sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution should be provided in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Python script (`hw_count_freq.py`) that reads from ``stdin`` and prints the frequency of each letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Bash script (`hw_count_all.sh`) that processes all files in the [`qwerty-dna/` directory](https://github.com/janezd/bio-python-ukazna/tree/master/zapiski/2025-05-13%20bash/qwerty-dna), and for each file outputs the letter frequencies. The Bash script should find all `.txt` files in the `qwerty-dna/` directory, run the Python script for each file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Follow the examples and procedures shown in [notes.ipynb](https://github.com/janezd/bio-python-ukazna/blob/master/zapiski/2025-05-13%20bash/notes.ipynb) and associated [examples](https://github.com/janezd/bio-python-ukazna/tree/master/zapiski/2025-05-13%20bash) from our last session.\n",

    "**Submission:** Send the solution by email to [me](mailto:tomaz.curk\\@fri.uni-lj.si?subject=Homework%20on%20Command%20Line) with Subject 'Homework on Command Line', attach the two scripts.\n",
